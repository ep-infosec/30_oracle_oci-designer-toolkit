## Code

Pull requests can be made under
[The Oracle Contributor Agreement](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/community/oca-486395.html) (OCA).

This repo is in early and active development. While we welcome contributions from the community, we may defer merging 
new functionality until the codebase stabilises. We have a list of great things we want to implement.  If you have
ideas get in touch directly or via the Oracle Technology Network OKIT discussion forum, so we don't duplicate efforts.

For pull requests to be accepted, the bottom of your commit message must have 
the following line using your name and e-mail address as it appears in the
OCA Signatories list.

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.org>
```

This can be automatically added to pull requests by committing with:

```
  git commit --signoff
```

Only pull requests from committers that can be verified as having
signed the OCA can be accepted.
